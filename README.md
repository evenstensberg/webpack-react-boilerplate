# webpack react boilerplate

This is a simple boilerplate for getting started with react, using webpack. The project doesn't use [Create React App](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/getting-started) and is good for prototyping a new application or getting started in frontend with no sandboxed environment.

## Usage

```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/evenstensberg/webpack-react-boilerplate.git
$ cd webpack-react-boilerplate
$ npm install
```
